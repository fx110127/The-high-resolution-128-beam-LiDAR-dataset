# The-high-resolution-128-beam-LiDAR-dataset
We will provide a water surface object detection dataset based on a 128-line high-resolution solid-state LiDAR, mainly containing three types of objects: a triangular buoy, a cubic buoy, and a USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) with a length of 1.75 meters. This dataset is intended to explore the application prospects of this device in water surface object detection.
